== merge

  When you join different tables in active record query 
  you will be able to use any scopes defined on any join table

  for example longest join we can do in the above model


  Person.joins(collaborations: { movies: { productions: :production_houses } })


  lets say i want to know all actors for superhero movies dccomics produced

  Person.
    joins(collaborations: { movie: { productions: :production_house } }).
    merge(Movie.superhero).
    merge(ProductionHouse.dccomics).
    merge(Collaboration.as_actor)

  SELECT "people".* FROM "people" 
  INNER JOIN "collaborations" ON "collaborations"."person_id" = "people"."id" 
  INNER JOIN "movies" ON "movies"."id" = "collaborations"."movie_id" 
  INNER JOIN "productions" ON "productions"."movie_id" = "movies"."id" 
  INNER JOIN "production_houses" ON "production_houses"."id" = "productions"."production_house_id" 
  WHERE "movies"."genre" = 'superhero' 
  AND "production_houses"."name" = 'DC Comics' 
  AND "collaborations"."role" = 'actor'
